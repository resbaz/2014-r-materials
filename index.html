<p>
The R lesson materials used by ResBaz are taken from a bootcamp run at the University 
of Sydney by Diego Barneche, Philipp Bayer, and Dan Warren in October 2013. You can
find a link to their bootcamp <a href="https://dbarneche.github.io/2014-10-31-USyd/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
These materials have been adapted from both 
<a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a> and 
<a href="www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s 
core R lesson materials.
